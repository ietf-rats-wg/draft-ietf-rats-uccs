               A CBOR Tag for Unprotected CWT Claims Sets
                      draft-ietf-rats-uccs-latest

Abstract

   This document defines the Unprotected CWT Claims Set (UCCS), a data
   format for representing a CBOR Web Token (CWT) Claims Set without
   protecting it by a signature, message authentication code (MAC), or
   encryption.  UCCS enables the use of CWT claims in environments where
   protection is provided by other means, such as secure communication
   channels or trusted execution environments.  This specification
   defines a CBOR tag for UCCS and describes the UCCS format, its
   encoding, and processing considerations, and discusses security
   implications of using unprotected claims sets.

1.  Introduction

   A CBOR Web Token (CWT) as specified by [RFC8392] is always wrapped in
   a CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE, [STD96]) envelope.  COSE
   provides -- among other things -- end-to-end data origin
   authentication and integrity protection employed by RFC 8392 as well
   as optional encryption for CWTs.  Under the right circumstances
   (Section 3), though, a signature providing proof for authenticity and
   integrity can be provided through the transfer protocol and thus
   omitted from the information in a CWT without compromising the
   intended goal of authenticity and integrity.  In other words, if
   communicating parties have a preexisting security association, they
   can reuse it to provide authenticity and integrity for their
   messages, enabling the basic principle of using resources
   parsimoniously.  Specifically, if a mutually secured channel is
   established between two remote peers, and if that secure channel
   provides the required properties (as discussed below), it is possible
   to omit the protection provided by COSE, creating a use case for
   unprotected CWT Claims Sets.  Similarly, if there is one-way
   authentication, the party that did not authenticate may be in a
   position to send authentication information through this channel that
   allows the already authenticated party to authenticate the other
   party; this effectively turns the channel into a mutually secured
   channel.

   This specification allocates a CBOR tag to mark Unprotected CWT
   Claims Sets (UCCS) as such and discusses conditions for its proper
   use in the scope of Remote Attestation Procedures (RATS [RFC9334])
   for the conveyance of RATS Conceptual Messages.

Internet-Draft         Unprotected CWT Claims Sets         November 2024


   This specification does not change [RFC8392]: An actual RFC 8392 CWT
   does not make use of the tag allocated here; the UCCS tag is an
   alternative to using COSE protection and a CWT tag.  Consequently,
   within the well-defined scope of a secure channel, it can be
   acceptable and economic to use the contents of a CWT without its COSE
   container and tag it with a UCCS CBOR tag for further processing
   within that scope -- or to use the contents of a UCCS CBOR tag for
   building a CWT to be signed by some entity that can vouch for those
   contents.

1.1.  Terminology

   The term Claim is used as in [RFC7519].

   The terms Claim Key, Claim Value, and CWT Claims Set are used as in
   [RFC8392].

   The terms Attester, Attesting Environment, Evidence, Relying Party
   and Verifier are used as in [RFC9334].

   UCCS:  Unprotected CWT Claims Set(s); CBOR map(s) of Claims as
      defined by the CWT Claims Registry that are composed of pairs of
      Claim Keys and Claim Values.

   Secure Channel:  [NIST-SP800-90Ar1] defines a Secure Channel as
      follows:

         |  "A path for transferring data between two entities or
         |  components that ensures confidentiality, integrity and
         |  replay protection, as well as mutual authentication between
         |  the entities or components.  The secure channel may be
         |  provided using approved cryptographic, physical or
         |  procedural methods, or a combination thereof."

      For the purposes of the present document, we focus on a protected
      communication channel used for conveyance that can ensure the same
      qualities as CWT without having the COSE protection available:
      mutual authentication, integrity protection, confidentiality.
      (Replay protection can be added by including a nonce claim such as
      Nonce (claim 10 [IANA.cwt]).)  Examples include conveyance via
      PCIe (Peripheral Component Interconnect Express) IDE (Integrity
      and Data Encryption) or a TLS tunnel.

   All terms referenced or defined in this section are capitalized in
   the remainder of this document.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [BCP14] (RFC2119) (RFC8174) when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

1.2.  Structure of this document

   Section 2 briefly discusses use cases for UCCS.  Section 3 addresses
   general characteristics of secure channels, followed by a specific
   discussion of using them in the context of RATS Conceptual Message
   Conveyance in Section 4, and finally some more forward-looking
   considerations for using UCCS in other RATS contexts in Section 5.
   Conventional sections (IANA Considerations, Security Considerations,
   Normative References, and Informative References) follow.  The
   normative Appendix A provides a formal definition of the structure of
   UCCS as no formal definition of CWT Claims Sets was provided in
   [RFC8392].  This employs the Concise Data Definition Language (CDDL)
   [RFC8610], using its ability to also describe the structurally
   similar Unprotected JWT Claims Sets [RFC7519] (UJCS) in the same
   definition.  Appendix B provides an (informative) example for CBOR-
   Tagged UCCS.  The normative Appendix C provides CDDL rules that add
   UCCS-format tokens to Entity Attestation Tokens (EATs, see
   [I-D.ietf-rats-eat]) using its predefined extension points.

2.  Deployment and Usage of UCCS

   Usage scenarios involving the conveyance of Claims, in particular
   RATS, require a standardized data definition and encoding format that
   can be transferred and transported using different communication
   channels.  As these are Claims, the Claims Sets defined in [RFC8392]
   are a suitable format.  However, the way these Claims are secured
   depends on the deployment, the security capabilities of the device,
   as well as their software stack.  For example, a Claim may be
   securely stored and conveyed using a device's Trusted Execution
   Environment (TEE, see [RFC9397]) or a Trusted Platform Module (TPM,
   see [TPM2]).  Especially in some resource-constrained environments,
   the same process that provides the secure communication transport is
   also the delegate to compose the Claim to be conveyed.  Whether it is
   a transfer or transport, a Secure Channel is presumed to be used for
   conveying such UCCS.  The following sections elaborate on Secure
   Channel characteristics in general and further describe RATS usage
   scenarios and corresponding requirements for UCCS deployment.

3.  Characteristics of a Secure Channel

   A Secure Channel for the conveyance of UCCS needs to provide the
   security properties that would otherwise be provided by COSE for a
   CWT.  In this regard, UCCS is similar in security considerations to
   JWTs [BCP225] using the algorithm "none".  Section 3.2 of RFC 8725
   [BCP225] states:

   |  [...] if a JWT is cryptographically protected end-to-end by a
   |  transport layer, such as TLS using cryptographically current
   |  algorithms, there may be no need to apply another layer of
   |  cryptographic protections to the JWT.  In such cases, the use of
   |  the "none" algorithm can be perfectly acceptable.

   The security considerations discussed, e.g., in Sections 2.1, 3.1,
   and 3.2 of RFC 8725 [BCP225] apply in an analogous way to the use of
   UCCS as elaborated on in this document.  In particular, the need to
   "Use Appropriate Algorithms" (Section 3.2 of RFC 8725 [BCP225])
   includes choosing appropriate cryptographic algorithms for setting up
   and protecting the Secure Channel.  For instance, their cryptographic
   strength should be at least as strong as any cryptographic keys the
   Secure Channel will be used for to protect in transport.  Table 5 in
   Section 7.2 provides references to some more security considerations
   for specific cryptography choices that are discussed in the COSE
   initial algorithms specification [RFC9053].

   Secure Channels are often set up in a handshake protocol that
   mutually derives a session key, where the handshake protocol
   establishes the (identity and thus) authenticity of one or both ends
   of the communication.  The session key can then be used to provide
   confidentiality and integrity of the transfer of information inside
   the Secure Channel.  (Where the handshake did not provide a mutually
   secure channel, further authentication information can be conveyed by
   the party not yet authenticated, leading to a mutually secured
   channel.)  A well-known example of a such a Secure Channel setup
   protocol is the TLS [RFC8446] handshake; the TLS record protocol can
   then be used for secure conveyance.

   As UCCS were initially created for use in RATS Secure Channels, the
   following section provides a discussion of their use in these
   channels.  Where other environments are intended to be used to convey
   UCCS, similar considerations need to be documented before UCCS can be
   used.

4.  UCCS in RATS Conceptual Message Conveyance

   This section describes a detailed usage scenario for UCCS in the
   context of RATS in conjunction with its attendant security
   requirements.  The use of UCCS tag CPA601 outside of the RATS context
   MUST come with additional instruction leaflets and security
   considerations.

   For the purposes of this section, any RATS role can be the sender or
   the receiver of the UCCS.

   Secure Channels can be transient in nature.  For the purposes of this
   specification, the mechanisms used to establish a Secure Channel are
   out of scope.

   In the scope of RATS Claims, the receiver MUST authenticate the
   sender as part of the establishment of the Secure Channel.
   Furthermore, the channel MUST provide integrity of the communication
   between the communicating RATS roles.  For data confidentiality
   [RFC4949], the receiving side MUST be authenticated as well; this is
   achieved if the sender and receiver mutually authenticate when
   establishing the Secure Channel.  The quality of the receiver's
   authentication and authorization will influence whether the sender
   can disclose the UCCS.

   The extent to which a Secure Channel can provide assurances that UCCS
   originate from a trustworthy Attesting Environment depends on the
   characteristics of both the cryptographic mechanisms used to
   establish the channel and the characteristics of the Attesting
   Environment itself.  The assurance provided to a Relying Party
   depends on the authenticity and integrity properties of the Secure
   Channel used for conveying the UCCS to it.

   Ultimately, it is up to the receiver's policy to determine whether to
   accept a UCCS from the sender and to determine the type of Secure
   Channel it must negotiate.  While the security considerations of the
   cryptographic algorithms used are similar to COSE, the considerations
   of the Secure Channel should also adhere to the policy configured at
   each of end of the Secure Channel.  However, the policy controls and
   definitions are out of scope for this document.

Internet-Draft         Unprotected CWT Claims Sets         November 2024


   Where an Attesting Environment serves as an endpoint of a Secure
   Channel used to convey a UCCS, the security assurance required of
   that Attesting Environment by a Relying Party generally calls for the
   Attesting Environment to be implemented using techniques designed to
   provide enhanced protection from an attacker wishing to tamper with
   or forge UCCS originating from that Attesting Environment.  A
   possible approach might be to implement the Attesting Environment in
   a hardened environment such as a TEE [RFC9397] or a TPM [TPM2].

   When UCCS emerge from the Secure Channel and into the receiver, the
   security properties of the secure channel no longer protect the UCCS,
   which now are subject to the same security properties as any other
   unprotected data in the Verifier environment.  If the receiver
   subsequently forwards UCCS, they are treated as though they
   originated within the receiver.

   The Secure Channel context does not govern fully formed CWTs in the
   same way it governs UCCS.  As with Entity Attestation Tokens (EATs,
   see [I-D.ietf-rats-eat]) nested in other EATs (Section 4.2.18.3
   (Nested Tokens) of [I-D.ietf-rats-eat]), the Secure Channel does not
   endorse fully formed CWTs transferred through it.  Effectively, the
   COSE envelope of a CWT (or a nested EAT) shields the CWT Claims Set
   from the endorsement of the secure channel.  (Note that EAT might add
   a nested UCCS Claim, and this statement does not apply to UCCS nested
   into UCCS, only to fully formed CWTs.)

5.  Considerations for Using UCCS in Other RATS Contexts

   This section discusses two additional usage scenarios for UCCS in the
   context of RATS.

5.1.  Delegated Attestation

   Another usage scenario is that of a sub-Attester that has no signing
   keys (for example, to keep the implementation complexity to a
   minimum) and has a Secure Channel, such as local inter-process
   communication, to interact with a lead Attester (see "Composite
   Device", Section 3.3 of [RFC9334]).  The sub-Attester produces a UCCS
   with the required CWT Claims Set and sends the UCCS through the
   Secure Channel to the lead Attester.  The lead Attester then computes
   a cryptographic hash of the UCCS and protects that hash using its
   signing key for Evidence, for example, using a Detached-Submodule-
   Digest or Detached EAT Bundle (Section 5 of [I-D.ietf-rats-eat]).

Internet-Draft         Unprotected CWT Claims Sets         November 2024


5.2.  Privacy Preservation

   A Secure Channel which preserves the privacy of the Attester may
   provide security properties equivalent to COSE, but only inside the
   life-span of the session established.  In general, when a privacy
   preserving Secure Channel is employed for conveying a conceptual
   message, the receiver cannot correlate the message with the senders
   of other received UCCS messages beyond the information the Secure
   Channel authentication provides.

   An Attester must consider whether any UCCS it returns over a privacy
   preserving Secure Channel compromises the privacy in unacceptable
   ways.  As an example, the use of the EAT UEID Claim (Section 4.2.1 of
   [I-D.ietf-rats-eat]) in UCCS over a privacy preserving Secure Channel
   allows a Verifier to correlate UCCS from a single Attesting
   Environment across many Secure Channel sessions.  This may be
   acceptable in some use-cases (e.g., if the Attesting Environment is a
   physical sensor in a factory) and unacceptable in others (e.g., if
   the Attesting Environment is a user device belonging to a child).

6.  IANA Considerations

6.1.  CBOR Tag registration

   In the CBOR Tags registry [IANA.cbor-tags] as defined in Section 9.2
   of RFC 8949 [STD94], IANA is requested to allocate the tag in Table 1
   from the Specification Required space (1+2 size), with the present
   document as the specification reference.

       |        | Appendix A of [RFCthis]) | Claims Set [RFCthis] |
       +--------+--------------------------+----------------------+

                         Table 1: Values for Tags


   // RFC-Editor: This document uses the CPA (code point allocation)

7.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of [STD94] apply.  The security
   considerations of [RFC8392] need to be applied analogously, replacing
   the function of COSE with that of the Secure Channel; in particular
   "it is not only important to protect the CWT in transit but also to
   ensure that the recipient can authenticate the party that assembled
   the claims and created the CWT".

   Section 3 discusses security considerations for Secure Channels, in
   which UCCS might be used.  This document provides the CBOR tag
   definition for UCCS and a discussion on security consideration for
   the use of UCCS in RATS.  Uses of UCCS outside the scope of RATS are
   not covered by this document.  The UCCS specification -- and the use
   of the UCCS CBOR tag, correspondingly -- is not intended for use in a
   scope where a scope-specific security consideration discussion has
   not been conducted, vetted and approved for that use.  In order to be
   able to use the UCCS CBOR tag in another such scope, the secure
   channel and/or the application protocol (e.g., TLS and the protocol
   identified by ALPN) MUST specify the roles of the endpoints in a
   fashion that the security properties of conveying UCCS via a Secure
   Channel between the roles are well-defined.

7.1.  General Considerations

   Implementations of Secure Channels are often separate from the
   application logic that has security requirements on them.  Similar
   security considerations to those described in [STD96] for obtaining
   the required levels of assurance include:

   *  Implementations need to provide sufficient protection for private
      or secret key material used to establish or protect the Secure
      Channel.





Birkholz, et al.           Expires 7 May 2025                  [Page 12]

Internet-Draft         Unprotected CWT Claims Sets         November 2024


   *  Using a key for more than one algorithm can leak information about
      the key and is not recommended.

   *  An algorithm used to establish or protect the Secure Channel may
      have limits on the number of times that a key can be used without
      leaking information about the key.

   *  Evidence in a UCCS conveyed in a Secure Channel generally cannot
      be used to support trust in the credentials that were used to
      establish that secure channel, as this would create a circular
      dependency.

   The Verifier needs to ensure that the management of key material used
   to establish or protect the Secure Channel is acceptable.  This may
   include factors such as:

   *  Ensuring that any permissions associated with key ownership are
      respected in the establishment of the Secure Channel.

   *  Using cryptographic algorithms appropriately.

   *  Using key material in accordance with any usage restrictions such
      as freshness or algorithm restrictions.

   *  Ensuring that appropriate protections are in place to address
      potential traffic analysis attacks.

7.2.  Algorithm-specific Security Considerations

   Table 5 provides references to some security considerations of
   specific cryptography choices that are discussed in [RFC9053].

Appendix A.  CDDL

   The Concise Data Definition Language (CDDL), as defined in [RFC8610]
   and [RFC9165], provides an easy and unambiguous way to express
   structures for protocol messages and data formats that use CBOR or
   JSON.

   [RFC8392] does not define CDDL for CWT Claims Sets.

   // RFC-Editor: This document uses the CPA (code point allocation)
   // convention described in [I-D.bormann-cbor-draft-numbers].  Please
   // replace the number 601 in the code blocks below by the value that
   // has been assigned for CPA601 and remove this note.

   The CDDL model in Figure 1 shows how to use CDDL for defining the CWT
   Claims Set defined in [RFC8392].  These CDDL rules have been built
   such that they also can describe [RFC7519] Claims sets by disabling
   feature "cbor" and enabling feature "json".

   UCCS-Untagged = Claims-Set
   UCCS-Tagged = #6.601(UCCS-Untagged)

   Claims-Set = {
    * $$Claims-Set-Claims
    * Claim-Label .feature "extended-claims-label" => any
   }
   Claim-Label = CBOR-ONLY<int> / text
   string-or-uri = text

   $$Claims-Set-Claims //= ( iss-claim-label => string-or-uri )
   $$Claims-Set-Claims //= ( sub-claim-label => string-or-uri )
   $$Claims-Set-Claims //= ( aud-claim-label => string-or-uri )
   $$Claims-Set-Claims //= ( exp-claim-label => ~time )
   $$Claims-Set-Claims //= ( nbf-claim-label => ~time )
   $$Claims-Set-Claims //= ( iat-claim-label => ~time )
   $$Claims-Set-Claims //= ( cti-claim-label => bytes )

   iss-claim-label = JC<"iss", 1>
   sub-claim-label = JC<"sub", 2>
   aud-claim-label = JC<"aud", 3>
   exp-claim-label = JC<"exp", 4>
   nbf-claim-label = JC<"nbf", 5>
   iat-claim-label = JC<"iat", 6>
   cti-claim-label = CBOR-ONLY<7>  ; jti in JWT: different name and text

   JSON-ONLY<J> = J .feature "json"
   CBOR-ONLY<C> = C .feature "cbor"
   JC<J,C> = JSON-ONLY<J> / CBOR-ONLY<C>

                  Figure 1: CDDL definition for Claims-Set

   Specifications that define additional Claims should also supply
   additions to the $$Claims-Set-Claims socket, e.g.:

   ; [RFC8747]
   $$Claims-Set-Claims //= ( 8: CWT-cnf ) ; cnf
   CWT-cnf = {
     (1: CWT-COSE-Key) //
     (2: CWT-Encrypted_COSE_Key) //
     (3: CWT-kid)
   }

   CWT-COSE-Key = COSE_Key
   CWT-Encrypted_COSE_Key = COSE_Encrypt / COSE_Encrypt0
   CWT-kid = bytes

   ;;; Insert the required CDDL from RFC 9052 to complete these
   ;;; definitions.  This can be done manually or automated by a
   ;;; tool that implements an import directive such as:
   ;# import rfc9052

   The above definitions, concepts and security considerations also
   define a JSON-encoded Claims-Set as encapsulated in a JWT.  Such an
   unsigned Claims-Set can be referred to as a "Unprotected JWT Claims
   Set", a "UJCS".  The CDDL definition of Claims-Set in Figure 1 can be
   used for a "UJCS":

   UJCS = Claims-Set

Appendix B.  Example

   This appendix is informative.

   The example CWT Claims Set from Appendix A.1 of [RFC8392] can be
   turned into a UCCS by enclosing it with a tag number CPA601:

    601(
      {
        / iss / 1: "coap://as.example.com",
        / sub / 2: "erikw",
        / aud / 3: "coap://light.example.com",
        / exp / 4: 1444064944,
        / nbf / 5: 1443944944,
        / iat / 6: 1443944944,
        / cti / 7: h'0b71'
      }
    )

Appendix C.  EAT

   The following CDDL adds UCCS-format and UJCS-format tokens to EAT
   using its predefined extension points (see Section 4.2.18 (submods)
   of [I-D.ietf-rats-eat]).

   $EAT-CBOR-Tagged-Token /= UCCS-Tagged
   $EAT-CBOR-Untagged-Token /= UCCS-Untagged

   $JSON-Selector /= [type: "UJCS", nested-token: UJCS]

Acknowledgements

   Laurence Lundblade suggested some improvements to the CDDL.  Carl
   Wallace provided a very useful review.
